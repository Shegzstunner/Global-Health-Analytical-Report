Recommendations
 
1.	Focus on Prevention and Treatment:
•	Increase focus on Cancer and COVID-19, as they have the highest mortality rates.
•	Improve recovery rates for HIV/AIDS, which has the lowest recovery rate.
 
2.	Targeted Interventions:
•	Prioritize interventions for the 19–35 age group and males, as they are the most affected demographics.
•	Focus on the top 5 affected countries (Russia, Germany, South Africa, South Korea, and the UK) for disease prevention and treatment programs.
 
3.	Vaccination and Awareness Campaigns:
•	Promote vaccination and awareness for COVID-19, Zika, and Dengue, as they are among the most common diseases.
 
4.	Monitor Trends:
•	Investigate the reasons behind the peak in disease cases in 2007 and the decline in recent years to replicate successful strategies.
 
5.	Resource Allocation:
•	Allocate resources equally across treatment types (surgery, therapy, vaccination, and medication), as their usage is evenly distributed.
 
6.	Global Collaboration:
•	Encourage international collaboration to address diseases with high prevalence and mortality rates, especially in the top 5 affected countries.
